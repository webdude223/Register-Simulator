# Register-Simulator
I am creating a register simulator based on a real world register that I use. My code is entirely my own, and is not borrowed or copied from any company. The program uses a MySQL database to store a list of groceries, then uses JSON to load the items as an array into Javascript. The page layout is designed with HTML5 and CSS.
